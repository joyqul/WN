1. Please simulate Rayleigh fading channel model. The environment settings are: 
    - the number of multi-paths in the channel is 15; 
    - the number of samples to generate is 100,000;
    - maximum Doppler frequency is 100 Hz; 
    - and sampling period is 0.0001 sec. 
    Please plot the received power in dB value v.s. time.

2. From our lecture notes, the system throughputs of three ARQ approaches, i.e., stop-and-wait (Ssaw), go-back-N(Sgbn), and selective repeat (Ssr). We assume the code rate is 1/3, and the fixed frame size is 1500 bytes, and the header length is 36 bytes. Besides, we set Rb = 10 Mbps, and D = 10^-5 sec.
     (1) Whatâ€™s the N value to make the transmission being efficient? Justify your answer and plot the figure.
     (2) When GBN will perform better than SR (i.e., the corresponding setting of bit error rate )?  Justify your answer and plot the figure.
